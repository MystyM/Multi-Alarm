Multi-Alarm is a network of devices tailored to houses containing either faulty door locking mechanisms, or forgetful people.
Mounting a reciever on any door surface that must be kept closed such as entrances, windows, refrigerators or freezers will allow a person pesessing a Multi-Alarm hub to be notified when a target door is left open for longer than a chosen alotted time.
